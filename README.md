# Dual Radio Map-Aware Flight Strategy Optimization for UAV-Based Inspection System
## Abstarct:This paper investigates a dual radio map-aware inspection system that employs a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in rural environments. The UAV is tasked with executing a series of mission-critical inspection operations while transmitting the collected data in real time under the guidance of pre-constructed radio maps. To enhance inspection efficiency and ensure low-latency data feedback, a joint optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously determine the inspection sequence and flight trajectory, with the objective of minimizing both mission completion time and data transmission delay. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework that integrates an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The IGA first derives a near-optimal inspection sequence by jointly considering flight distance, uplink communication throughput, and downlink outage duration based on ground-to-air and air-to-ground radio maps. Subsequently, the DRL module refines the continuous flight trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-IGA outperforms benchmark schemes, achieving up to a 20% reduction in both total task completion time and transmission delay
