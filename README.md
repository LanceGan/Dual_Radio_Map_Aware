# Dual Radio Map-Aware Flight Strategy Optimization for UAV-Based Inspection System

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a cellular-connected UAV inspection system that optimizes both flight trajectory and inspection sequence using dual radio maps. The system employs a hybrid algorithm combining Improved Genetic Algorithm (IGA) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to minimize mission completion time and data transmission delay in rural environments.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Dual Radio Map Integration**: Leverages both Ground-to-Air (G2A) and Air-to-Ground (A2G) radio maps for comprehensive communication awareness
- **Hybrid Optimization**: Combines IGA for discrete inspection sequence planning and DRL for continuous trajectory optimization
- **Real-time Data Transmission**: Ensures reliable uplink data offloading while maintaining stable downlink connectivity
- **Rural Environment Adaptation**: Uses 3GPP Rural Macro (RMa) channel model for realistic propagation characteristics

## üèó System Architecture

The system consists of:
- **Cellular-connected UAV** with high-resolution camera for inspection tasks
- **Multiple GBS sectors** providing cellular connectivity
- **Pre-constructed radio maps** (G2A and A2G) guiding communication-aware path planning
- **Mission-critical inspection points** requiring real-time data transmission

## ‚ö° Problem Formulation

The joint optimization problem minimizes:

Where:
- **T**: Total mission completion time
- **œÑ_total**: Total transmission delay

### Constraints:
- Single sector association per time step
- Complete data offloading between inspection points
- Maximum outage duration limit
- UAV kinematic constraints
- Boundary conditions

## üß† Algorithm: DRL-IGA

### Phase 1: Inspection Sequence Optimization (IGA)
- Models the problem as a modified Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Defines composite edge weights considering:
  - Flight distance
  - Uplink communication throughput
  - Downlink outage duration
- Uses genetic algorithm for near-optimal sequence determination

### Phase 2: Flight Trajectory Optimization (DRL)
- Employs Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
- State space: UAV position, data buffer, target coordinates
- Action space: Velocity and heading angle
- Reward function balancing mission completion and communication quality

## üìä Performance Results

The proposed DRL-IGA demonstrates significant improvements:

- **Up to 20% reduction** in total task completion time and transmission delay compared to baseline methods
- **Balanced optimization** of uplink data rates and downlink outage duration
- **Effective avoidance** of low-coverage regions while maintaining efficient flight paths

### Comparison with Baseline Methods:
- **TSP**: Considers only flight distance, ignores radio maps
- **DRL-SA**: Uses simulated annealing with G2A map only
- **DRL-IGA (Ours)**: Jointly utilizes both G2A and A2G radio maps
